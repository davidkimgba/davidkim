<h2> Project 1.1.9 PLTW </h2>
<p> Our program is an apple tree and a cloud in front of the night sky with differently sized stars. The cloud moves back and forth in a loop and the program then checks if the user clicks the apple or not and if the user clicks the apple, it will fall.

<h2> Project 1.2.5 PLTW </h2>
<p> Our program is a game with a user controllable Shark. The user must control a shark through a maze and eat the fish at different parts of the maze. The program randomly generates a maze as well as fish locations. The program also detects if the user hits a wall, and if a wall is hit the game stops. A score counter is in the top left corner, the user "wins" the game by eating all 10 fish.</p>
